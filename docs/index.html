								<h3>My Projects</h3>
								<p>Below are a few hands-on projects that I worked on.</p>
								<div class="features">
									<article>
										<a href="https://github.com/VenkataViswanath/Project-Asvins" class="image"><img src="images/Project Asvins Thumbnail .png" alt="" /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>Project Asvins - Patient Healthcare Managment system</h4>
											<p>Project Asvins is a one-stop web platform hub for all things healthcare. The goal of Project Asvins is to organize resources for patients, doctors, and insurance agencies so that they can access everything they need right in one place. Patients will be able to find doctors that fit their needs and contact them right through their browser, they will also be able to manage their insurance and easily see to do tasks for upcoming appointments. Doctors will be able to access their patient's medical history and give feedback. Insurance agencies will be able to view their patient’s information and communicate deals and information to patients. </p>
											<p>Skills learned and applied: Database Design, Data Modeling, MongoDB, API Design, management and security, Agile methodologies, Git, Express JS, Node JS</p>

										<div class="inner">
											<h4>Grand File Share</h4>
											<p>The Grand File Sharing Application helps users to seamlessly upload and download files in a centralized location with a simple user interface. It leverages AWS services like Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS to achieve scalability, reliability, and efficient storage.
											</p>
											<p>Skills learned and applied: Application Design, Python, Infrastructure As Code, Amazon Web Services, AWS Elastic Cloud Compute, AWS Relational Database Service, AWS Simple Storage Service</p>

									<article>
										<a href="https://github.com/VenkataViswanath/EmployeeChurnPrediction" class="image"><img src="images/Project Employee Churn Prediction thumbnail.png" alt="GrandFile share" /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>Employee Churn Prediction</h4>
											<p>Retaining current employees is more difficult for the HR team than recruiting new ones. Any business that loses one of its valuable employees suffers a loss in terms of productivity, time, money, and other factors. This loss could be reduced if HR could able to foresee future employees who were considering leaving their positions; as a result, we looked into ways to address the employee turnover issue from a machine learning perspective through this project. When the time comes to lay off workers as part of organizational changes, the corporation can use churn modeling to make a rational decision rather than randomly selecting layoff candidates.</p>
											<p>Skills learned and applied: Data collection, Data Mining, Data Pre Processing, Python, Pandas, Exploratory Data Analysis, Dimensionality Reduction, Machine Learning algorithms, Tuning ML model performance</p>

										<a href="https://github.com/VenkataViswanath/product-sales-analytics-powerbi" class="image"><img src="images/Project Product Sales analysis thumbnail.png" alt="GrandFile share" /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>Product Sales Analysis</h4>
											<p>I had the privilege of working on a transformative project in which I oversaw the implementation of Power BI for in-depth data analysis of our product sales. The result was a suite of interactive dashboards that not only provided access to key metrics but also enabled advanced customer segmentation and precise forecasting capabilities. These dashboards empowered with the insights needed for informed decision-making, allowing to steer businesses in the right direction and drive substantial improvements in overall performance.</p>
											<p>Skills learned and applied: Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Power Query Editor, Data Modeling, Information Visualization, Business Intelligence, Power BI</p>

										<a href="https://github.com/VenkataViswanath/E-Nose-Project/blob/main/README.md" class="image"><img src="images/Project ENose Thumbnail.png" alt="GrandFile share" /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>Electronic Nose for Real-time Air Quality Monitoring</h4>
											<p>We created a device which classifies Air Quality in real-time. The heart of this endeavor lay in the comprehensive dataset we curated. Data collection spanned diverse environments, capturing a spectrum of air quality conditions. This step was pivotal in ensuring the accuracy and robustness of the subsequent machine learning phase. With a well-prepared dataset in hand, we ventured into the realm of machine learning. The objective was to create a system capable of not only monitoring air quality but also providing accurate classifications when faced with new and untested environmental data inputs. The results were indeed remarkable. The system consistently achieved a classification accuracy exceeding 90% when confronted with previously unseen environmental data.</p>
											<p>Skills learned and applied: Data Collection, Data Profiling, Data Transformation, Sensors, Arduino, Machine Learning Classifiers, Real-time predictions, ML Hyper-parameter tuning</p>
